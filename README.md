# BRL-CAD Landing Page Designs Showcase GCI14
The web page  lists each contributor, displays a preview of the design as an image (screenshot) and then after clicking on the image you
get the full-screen view as how it will look and also there is link to the actual design. The task was created by BRL-CAD during 
Google Code-in 2014.
